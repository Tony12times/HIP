# HIP XX: Vacate Backlogged Crowdspot Submissions 
- Author(s): @tony12times 
- Start Date: 2023-06-21
- Category: Meta
- Original HIP PR: 721
- Tracking Issue:
- Voting Requirements: veIOT

## Summary
- Allow selected hotspots from the January 12, 2023 algorithmic detection, approximately 3700 of 19670, to be removed from the denylist 
- Update the programming of the machine learning model (algorithm detection iteration)
- Re-sweep for gamers approximately 7 days later [^7] with a better algorithm 

## Motivation

It has been known for some time that a large number of hotspots were denied in error in January, 2023 [^1] and remain on the denylist for months without recourse.  A lack of personel and resources for the review team has resulted in a backlog of over 4000 submissions, containing 4600 Hotspots, backlogged for 6 months. [^2] This has bred an atmosphere of mistrust, conspiracy theories, and FUD within the community in regards to how the denylist and Crowdspot are handled. [^8]  
> Denylist - state on: 2023-07-05T13:30:01.191Z
> Removal pending time [avg/max]= [131.5 days / 171.1 days]. There are 4048 pending removal submissions.

 **It's time to clear the log jam, reset the algorithm, and try again.**

## Stakeholders

- All hotspot owners will be positively affected by this proposal by returning legit hotspots back to POC activity on the network.
- Any community member that manually detects a spoofed hotspot or farm on the network has little to gain by reporting an addition request to Crowdspot if the request isn't reviewed for 171 days. [^2]
- Any hotspot owners that were inaccurately put on the denylist in January 2023 are negatively affected by the current state of Crowdspot. 

## Detailed Explanation

### Four steps

1. Identify & remove stale requests on Crowdspot 
2. New sweep on new POC data with new detection model
3. Review Team clears out Crowdspot in a resonable time
4. Repeat as needed

### 1. Identify the selection to be removed from stale submissions on Crowdspot and the denylist 

I am currently waiting on this select hotspot list to be generated and will publish the exact list alongside this PR.  
This list will be less than 3664 hotspots. [^2] [^9]
> Denylist - state on: 2023-07-05T13:30:01.191Z
> Hotspots*:    | accepted 1550 | declined 1075 | pending 3664

Start with the 4100 pending submissions, containing 4600 hotspots, then keep only the hotspots that were placed on the denylist on the latest algorithmic detection. 
At the current time, this is *2023011001 PR #8297 https://github.com/helium/denylist/pull/8297/files/d3a3dfe659f620859ae97ff574a45b7313836816

From those, keep only submissions that have not previously been seen and reviewed by the review team. (Not appeals, not second looks, not additions) This will have to be sourced from crowdspot.io to filter out hotspots from older removal submissions "declined" by the review team.

These identified hotspots will be removed from the denylist without a review.  Place these identified submissions and hotspots on a denylist pull request for removal.  Successful signature and merger of this PR will close them in Crowdspot and remove them from the denylist.  

### 2. Start a new sweep cycle based on new POC data

Wait 7 days [^7] or whatever time is needed by the denylist authors to update the learning model and develop a more accurate gaming detection algorithm, then run the algorithmic detection again.  A maximum number of hotspots are added to the denylist per sweep in accordance with the formula below.

### 3. The review team clears out Crowdspot submissions in a reasonable time frame 

I think the community should have a reasonable "customer service expectation" to wait for a review set between 14-30 days.  

### 4. Repeat the Sweep and clear Crowdspot again

Once Crowdspot returns to a manageable level of submissions, perhaps 1-3 days left of reviews for the review team, repeat at step 2.

It maybe necessary at times to repeat this process from step 1 instead of step 2 if the submissions to Crowdspot become stalled again.  A maximum time out of 90 days will exist for any Crowdspot removal submissions that grow stale, and trigger a repeat at step 1 of this HIP.

#### Formula for Maximum Hotspots added per Iteration 

On subsequent algorithmic detection sweeps, only add a specific maximum number of hotspots to the denylist per sweep.  The max number added to the denylist each time can be increased by putting foward a more accurate algorithm each time its ran.  As the algorithm becomes more accurate, fewer hotspots are found to be false positive, then the submission rate to Crowdspot will decrease. Also, The maximum number added per iteration can be increased by adding more personnel to the review team.

The maximum number of hotspots that are added to the denylist per sweep will be determined by the following formula: 
[Average reviews per day]  *  [number of days to clear out the reviews] รท [percentage of denied hotspots that open a Crowdspot submission]  

Reviews worked per day = 6.48  [^4]
The Crowdspot submission reporting rate was 29.1% in the last iteration. [^2]
The number of days to clear out the reviews is discussed in depth under Unresolved Questions.  

Using the current averages, the examples would be:
60 days x 6.48 รท 29.1% = 1336
30 days x 6.48 รท 29.1% = 668
14 days x 6.48 รท 29.1% = 312

## Drawbacks

Yes, we would be returning some potential gaming hotspots back to the POC pool.  We would also be returning some innocent hotspots back to the pool.  This number is less than 3664 total, gaming and innocent hotspots.  An estimated ratio of innocent to guilty can be inferred from data available below. [^2]   60% innocent vs 40% gamers in the sample of 2549 reviews conducted between January and June. 
> Denylist - state on: 2023-06-22T13:30:01.128Z
> Applications: | accepted 1489| declined 1060 | pending 3579
> Hotspots*:    | accepted 1480 | declined 1048 | pending 3725

## Rationale and Alternatives

The rational is simple, there are potentially a thousand false positive hotspots on the denylist, and within the 4100 pending submissions on crowdspot. There is no method in place or manpower available to review them in any reasonable time.  Many have been waiting for a review for 5 months and would have to wait many more months for a review or for model coverage to change the methodology of the denylist.  Those falsely accused have no recourse within the current framework of the denylist and Crowdspot management.  It's just time to reset and try again.

Alternatives:
- HIP 40 : was written for validators, pre Solana.   It would have decentralized the denylist and its management.  It never went to vote.
- HIP 66: established trust score for denylist detection and determination. This was also written pre-Solana and never went to a vote.   
- PR 551:  hold rewards for false positive hotspots, was written pre Solana
- PR 662: changed Crowdspot process, established staked bond.  Very bulky and needs resource commitment to code it.  

## Unresolved Questions

### Resonable Time for the Review Team?

This has been the main question refered to throughout this HIP. 

- What is a resonable time for a review? 

Helium Foundation is going to have to answer this question from a customer service standpoint.  
This HIP ties that timeframe to the question:

- What is a reasonable time per iteration of the ML/AI algorithm?

The answer to both of these questions have a lot to consider. It needs to be kept at something that a resonable person can deal with their hotspot being falsely accused and being unrewarded, while waiting on a resonable recourse, the human review.  It also needs to be kept at a resonable learning curve for the algorithm. New additions to the denylist need to continue via the algorithm for the next 35K identified gamers.  Waiting 6 months between iteration is not a learning curve. 
The regular flow and iteration schedule should be left up to Nova Lab's discretion as the custodian of the denylist.  The expected customer/ user experience of the Helium Network is up to the Foundation to determine.  The answers to these questions is theirs' to ponder.

- How do we keep this from happening again?  
- How do we beef up the personel on the review team?  
- Are there any ideas on how we can make them a paid job?

Nova was granted the authority to temporarily, yet unilaterally manage the denylist in a vote in 2022.  The intention at that time was that HIP 40 would soon go to a vote and the implementation of decentralized denylists was at hand.  Because this has not been corrected in the past 18 months, a vacancy of resources needed to manage the Crowdspot submissions has collapsed the process. [^4] Very few hotspots get removed or added to the denylist by hand, the algorithmic detection hasn't been ran in 5 months [^3], and FUD of the denylist and gamers has taken over in Discord channels.  
- How do we keep this from happening again?

The rest of the unresolved questions are not really for this HIP, but rather for the community:
- What is the solution for the denylist as a whole?
- Will there be a HIP for modeled coverage that will eliminate the denylist?  
- Will it always remain as part of a multi pronged approach to network security? If so, then who should manage it?

##Deployment Impact

Who will have to do what work? 
The expectation is that a memeber of the review team will open a PR and add the selected hotspots to the PR.  Two other memebers will have to add signatures to the PR, then the PR can be merged into the denylist. 

What docs.helium.com will need updating?  I have reviewed the relevant Helium Docs [^6] and do not find any materials here that would need to be updated as a result of enacting this HIP.  Please let me know of you find any.  @tony12times commits to work on these relevant Docs if needed or identified.  

Can this HIP be undone?
Yes, because the denylist is a dynamic document, it can be done, redone, and undone again.

##Success Metrics

The success metric will be the wait time for conducting a human review after placing a submission. A second success metric will be seeing the algorithmic detection model grow more accurate and the time between sweep cycles (iterations) drop to a very rapid pace.  

Like pointed out in the Motivation, the threshold for review should be less than 5 months, maybe even 30 days. The expected "customer service experience" should dictate that 5 months or 24 months wait is simply unreasonable.  Any wait this long sows mistrust, conspiracy theories, and FUD.

[^9] Remember none of these hotspots have been rewarded since January.  Many are possibly powered off and removed from the network.  Many will probably never go live on Helium Network ever again.  The list of live hotspots that are removed from the denylist will likely be far less than 3600 of the 157,000 hotspots on the denylist.
