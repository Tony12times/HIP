## Summary:
This HIP seeks to remodel the denylist processes within the existing infrastructure of Crowdspot.io.  Improvements to the review process will streamline the wait time for Crowdspot reviews, reduce redundant removal submissions from identified gamers, better categorizing reviews, and establishing definitions for use in the review process. The two main goals of reducing bad actors on the network and processing false positive cases in a more timely manner will be accomplished by two innovative steps. First, a Staking Bond will be required to place any removal submission on Crowdspot.  Second, a two stage process is established on Crowdspot to handle appeals of hotspots already on the denylist.    

## Motivation:

The threshold for review should be less than 60 days, maybe even 30 days.  This HIP seeks to achieve these goals through updating Crowdspot with some new processes.

The current process and flow of the Crowdspot submissions is backlogged and in desperate need of overhaul and attention.  The Crowdspot submissions list controls the manual addition of gamers to the denylist and the manual removal of honest hotspot operators off of the denylist.  This is not to be confused with automatic algorithmic detection methods.  The current wait time for the 4100 manual review log jam is approaching 4 months. The requests to Crowdspot will continue to grow even longer if the process isn't improved.  This has resulted in thousands of false positive cases that can't get off the denylist for months at a time.

As of the draft of this proposal, the wait time is 114 days based on historical wait times on Crowdspot, but this does not take into account the rate of new submissions since January's algorithmic detection added 5600 new submissions, nor April's Solana migration that has nearly halted all progress for the past 30 days.  
     
## Stakeholders:
All Hotspot owners will be positively affected by this proposal, due to the processing of false positive cases in a timely manner, and returning legit hotspots back to active on the network. 
All Hotspot owners that were put on the denylist since January 2023 are negativity affected by the current state of Crowdspot processing review requests. 
Any community member that manually detects a spoofed hotspot or farm on the network has nothing to gain by reporting the fraudulent activity if the request cant be reviewed for 6 months.  

## Detailed Explanation: 


Definitions clarified and variables to be established in this HIP

Staked bond- An amount of HNT to be locked up via Crowdspot and the Helium Wallet to accompany any removal submissions as a good faith pledge by the hotspot owner.  The bond is intended to stifle known gamers from clogging the review system with frivolous removal submissions of obvious gaming hotspots.

Initial removal submission- After being denied by algorithmic detection, 
a request may be submitted by a hotspot owner via Crowdspot to have a member of the review team research the POC data of a hotspot to determine if the hotspot should be removed from the denylist. 

Appeal removal submission- After the denial of an "initial removal submission" or after being placed on the denylist via an "addition request", a second and final request may be submitted by a hotspot owner via Crowdspot to have a second member of the review team determine if the hotspot should be removed from the denylist. 

Addition submission-  a request submitted by any member of the community via Crowdspot to have a member of the review team determine that POC gaming is present, and place the hotspot onto the denylist. 

Due notice of change- A message sent to the owner of any hotspot, via the Notifications section within the Helium Wallet, with regards to change of status on the denylist and of change of status on removal submissions initiated by the owner.   No reason, data, explanation, or guarantee shall be required in the notice.  Hotspot(s) name, and status is only required to be communicated.   

It is expected in the discussion process to determine exact values for two variables used throughout this HIP.   At this time, I don't know what they should be, therefore they are open for discussion. Discussion should be held under the subsection titled "Unresolved Questions".  These variables are intended to become constant values once before merging.  

var_submission_expiration_time = 60 days
var_staked_bond_amount = 5 HNT



Changes to the Crowdspot UI or front-end
   
   The Crowdspot website will be modified to give the user the options for the following.   
When creating any removal submission the types "Initial" or "Appeal"  will be selected by the form based on prior submissions and based on how the hotspot(s) came to be on the denylist.  An "i" information box will be present next to each selection with the definition from this HIP of each type of removal submission.   
When creating any removal submission a section for Stakes Bond will be presented.  An "i" informational box will be present within this selection with the definition from this HIP for Staked Bond.   The user will have a check box present to indicate (insert legal disclaimer here)  "I understand that the HNT staked for the purpose of this submission may be forfeited if it is determined by the review team that I have represented my hotspot falsely to the network". 
Owner's shall be given access to cancel their own pending submissions of either type of removal submissions in the pending status, prior to a determination by the review team.  Owner cancelation discretion comes with penalties as discussed in Owner Deadlines
 Any "voting" references within Crowdspot shall be removed, as it has no bearing on approvals or denials, and only serves to cloud the community's perception of how Crowdspot actually works.  
The Crowdspot.io URL should be included under the globe in the bottom right of the Helium Wallet App to ease access to persons needing to make addition or removal submissions. 


Changes to Crowdspot backend.   
Only the hotspot owner can create a removal submission on a hotspot that they own.
Only one removal submission can exist per hotspot at a time. 
The owner must include a staked bond with any type of removal submission.  
No other wallet shall be used for locking the staking bond other than the wallet currently linked to Crowdspot. 
The total Staked Bond will be a product of the number hotspots included on the submission multiplied by var_staked_bond_amount HNT. 
A mechanism shall be put in place to route any appeal submission to a different member of the review team than it's initial submission. 
Due Notice of change shall be sent to the hotspot owner regarding changes to their denylist status and/or changes to their submission status. 
At the time a hotspot address is being entered on a removal submission form, the data must be validated against the denylist and Crowdspot to determine the appropriate type of removal request to be labeled on the submission.  Initial removal submissions are permitted for hotspots that were denied via algorithmic detection and have not had a prior addition submission that was "accepted" by the review team.   Appeal removal submissions are permitted for hotspots that have a prior addition submission "accepted" by the review team  or have a prior initial removal submission as "declined" by the review team.   
In the event that an owner attempts to add multiple hotspots to a submission that are of mixed "initial" and "appeal" types, the form data shall not be validated and an error message shall alert the owner to try one hotspot per submission.  
Only one initial removal submission and one appeal removal submission on a particular hotspot can ever be worked by the review team.  Once a determination of "declined" has been decided for an appeal submission, no removal submission can be accepted for that particular hotspot.  



 Staked Bond in detail:

     The staked bond amount shall be var_staked_bond_amount HNT per hotspot. (This was intended to be approximately equivalent to the average network earnings of one hotspot for var_submission_expiration_time days.)  Only one staked bond shall be locked up for the initial and appeal removal submission.  The staked bond shall be carried over from an initial removal submission into an appeal removal submission provided that the owner creates the appeal removal submission within var_submission_expiration_time days of the denial determination by the review team.   

   The staked bond shall be immediately returned to the owner's wallet under any one of these three conditions:  
 Any removal submission is approved by the review team and POC gaming was not substantiated. 
An Owner Cancelation is executed on an initial removal submission prior to a determination by the review team.  Appeal removal submission stake bonds can not be recovered by owner cancellation. See OWNER DEADLINES for details.  
The var_submission_expiration_time day time limit for any submission to be reviewed has expired. See REVIEW TEAM DEADLINES for details.  

  

The staked bond shall be forfeited and burned under either of these two conditions:
On the var_submission_expiration_time +1 day (ie. 31st , 61st, 91st) after the initial removal submission was denied because the review team has positively determined that POC gaming was present and the owner does not have an open appeal removal submission.
In the event that an appeal removal submission is denied as the review team has positively determined that POC gaming is still present despite thoroughly pondering the most currently available evidence. 


OWNER DEADLINES AND RESPONSIBILITIES:

         There are time limits and responsibilities incumbent on the owner in regards to recovering a staked bond.   Once a staked bond has been attached to a submission there is no guarantee that it will be returned to you.  This is intended to be a good faith deposit to assert to the review team that you are not gaming the network.

The Owner of the hotspot is responsible for the following prior to any removal submission.
Be sure that you are aware of the deadlines listed below
Be sure that your hotspot is correctly asserted on the explorer map.  
Be sure that you are asserting the correct height and gain of the antenna you are using. 
Be sure that you have proper coax and connections.  
Be sure there are no gaming devices, or other unauthorized methods used to gain an unfair advantage to POC activity.
Be sure that you are giving all the true and factual information, photographic evidence and attaching pictures of your setup to the submission.  It is highly recommended that a file share site is used for all evidence so that addition info can be added without having to cancel and resubmit.

       
Owner Cancelation of an initial removal submission. 
The owner shall immediately and automatically recover a staked bond by executing an Owner Cancelation of the initial removal submission prior to a determination by the review team.  The hotspot(s) will remain on the denylist, and the staked bond will be immediately returned.  The owner may make another initial removal submission, to include additional evidence, additional hotspots and the required stake bond within var_submission_expiration_time days of the algorithmic detection, not from the date of executing an owner cancellation of a prior submission.  


Owner cancellation of an appeal removal submission.
       The owner shall not be able to recover a stake bond by canceling an appeal removal submission under any circumstance.   The owner may cancel an appeal removal submission, however the hotspot(s) will remain on the denylist and the staked bond will not be returned.   The staked bond may be attached to a new appeal removal submission only for the same hotspots(s) and only within var_submission_expiration_time days of  the initial removal submission being denied, or within var_submission_expiration_time days of the addition submission being sustained, not the date of cancelation.  

     There will be a var_submission_expiration_time day deadline to make an appeal removal submission after an addition submission has been substantiated by a member of the review team and the hotspot has been denied, however, the owner only gets access to the appeal removal submission when creating the submission.  An initial removal submission will not be available via the Crowdspot interface if the hotspot was placed on the denylist by the team via an addition submission. That is to say, if the team member already reviewed the data and determined that POC gaming was present, then the owner does not get an initial review, only an appeal.  

REVIEW TEAM DEADLINES:

     Initial removal submission shall be reviewed by the team within var_submission_expiration_time days or  the hotspot is removed from the denylist, the stake bond shall be returned to the hotspot owner, and the submission shall be closed with the status of approved.  This is not to say that the algorithmic detection can not immediately deny the hotspot again upon its first fraudulent POC activity.  

    An appeal removal submission has already had one team review by a human and possibly got there in the first place by algorithmic detection.  This case deserves a second look by the review team, however in the case that an appeal removal submission has not been reviewed in var_submission_expiration_time days the following shall occur.   The hotspot shall remain on the denylist, the stake bond shall be returned to the owner, and the submission shall be changed to the type addition submission and placed in that que for the review team at a later date.  

## Drawbacks

## Rationale and Alternatives


I'm a big proponent of the "innocent until proven guilty" ethos. Right alongside this goes "the right to a fair and speedy trial."  The current state of Crowdspot serves neither  

Think of it like this...  
Charges, Conviction, Appeal.  
Charges - the hotspot is placed on the additions list by a reporting party (just like we do it now);  or a hotspot is placed on the additions list because is has had its timer expire while waiting for human review in stage two appeal.   
Conviction- The hotspot is currently on the denylist due to suspicious POC activity.  The hotspot may have been denied via algorithmic detection or the hotspot was added to the deny list via the additions submissions list because the review team determined it was gaming.  
First appeal - once placed on the denylist by algorithmic means the owner gets a right to a speedy human review.  This can result in removal from the denylist or substantiated the algorithm's findings.  
Final Appeal- you get one chance for a 2nd human (and different person) to review after the initial submission confirmed gaming. 


What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not choosing them?
HIP 66 and fork 551 both sought to 


What is the impact of not doing this?

Each week more submissions are added to Crowdspot than are being removed.  The time for a review will grow so long that owners of legit hotspots that get falsely accused will have virtually no recourse.  Being put on the denylist will be equivalent to a perma-ban. 

Each day submissions are added to Crowdspot by already identified gamers asking for a review of the previous review of a farm that was denied 9 months ago, and further bogging down the system.  This revolving door must be stopped and penalties should be enacted for simply bogging down the system.  


 The proposals of this HIP do not undermine the need and impact of the denylist as a whole.  There will always be gamers, therefore there will always be a need of policing those bad actors.  On the alternative side there will occasionally be falsely accused persons.  This HIP only seeks to help identify and clear those falsely accused in an efficient manner.  

 Since the beginning of the denylist, in the old Github repository prior to October 2022, we understood that gamers continued gaming for months while the Github addition/removal list grew longer and longer.  When we moved over to the Crowdspot method, the list of additions to the denylist only grew, and still little attention was given to processing those requests.  Only since the implementation of algorithmic detection has the need for manual additions to the denylist become less useful.  Additions to the denylist via manual review are not the primary target of this HIP.  Manual additions are important, however improvements to the algorithm, and additions to the denylist via algorithm detection will continue to make manual additions process less important moving forward.  However, the requests for removal from the denylist make up about 99% of the pending submissions in Crowdspot.  For example, in the month of April, 2023 there were only 18 addition requests compared to around 300 removal requests placed on crowdspot.  In the current state, most of those requests won't be looked at until nearly 2024!

Unresolved Questions

How long is unreasonable to wait for review? 
How much HNT to stake to hold your place on the list?
What to do with the 4100 backlogged requests?

It is expected in the discussion process to determine the following variables in this HIP.  These current variables are only intended for the discussion process and are intended to become static once the discussion is finalized. 

var_submission_expiration_time = 60
var_staked_bond_amount = 5

The staked bond amount is intended to be approximately equivalent to the network average earnings of one hotspot for var_submission_expiration_time days.

For example 
0.07 HNT for 1 day
2.5 HNT for 30 days
5 HNT for 60 days


What about the 4100 submissions (4600 hotspots) that are currently backlogged on Crowdspot?   
Keep in mind that the current Crowdspot data from Jan 12th sweep to date has shown about 1400 false positive hotspots were put on the deny list, 900 were determined to be gaming after human review, and 3600 still are pending reviews.  Then another approximately 800 hotspots are pending review that were not in the Jan 12 sweep.  

I have a couple of scenarios to clear out the log jam,  but I haven't worked out exactly what to do.  I'm really looking to the community (and perhaps members of the current review team) for the best answer.  

Scenario 1  Delete the entire crowdspot backlog and make everyone re-file under the new rules.  We have the algorithmic detection re-canvas these 4600 hotspots and allow some of them, to be determined by the algorithm, to be released from the denylist.  The others have the submission deleted, and given due notice that the owner has to re-file under the new rules of this HIP. 

Scenario 2  wipe the backlog and remove those on the back log from the denylist.   We release all the hotspots currently on removal requests back into the POC pool for 30 days and let the algorithmic detection do its job with a new sweep.  When the new wave of submissions come in to Crowdspot, the new rules apply. Perhaps a percentage of these hotpots have given up on Helium and unplugged and will never be heard from again anyway.  Perhaps the algorithmic detection has been tweaked enough since the January sweep to be less heavy handed.  Perhaps we will just encourage cheaters to keep cheating, this would be the worst case scenario IMHO.   

Scenario 3  We control release of the submissions in scenario 2.  Only release 500 hotspots at a time and allow them to start POC activity again. Also, only release hotspots that were algorithmic detected on Jan 12th, definitely not hotspots that were manually determined.  Allow algorithmic detection to sweep them with a focus on those 500 hotspots, as they were previously suspected/detected of gaming.  This will slowly ease the backlog on crowdspot. All new removal requests that filter into Crowdspot are subject to the new rules of this HIP.  

Scenario 4  Keep the backlog of 4600 denied hotspots and submissions pending in crowdspot and start making any new submissions subject to the new rules.  I think that legit false positive owners will abandon the 4 month old submission and gladly "put their money where their mouth is".  

## Deployment Impact

This portion is reserved for future use. 


## Success Metrics

The success metric will be the wait time for getting a human review after being placed on the denylist.   Like pointed out in the Summary, the threshold for review should be less than 60 days, maybe even 30 days.
The expected "customer service experience" should dictate that 4-6 months is simply unreasonable.
