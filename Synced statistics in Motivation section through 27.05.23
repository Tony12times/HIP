## Summary:

There will always be gamers, therefore there will always be a need for policing those bad actors.  The proposals of this HIP aim to reinforce the impact of the denylist as a whole.  Penalties for POC gaming under this proposal are more harsh than the current process.
Incidentally, there will occasionally be falsely accused hotspots.  This HIP seeks to identify and clear those falsely accused in a timely manner.
The two main goals are reducing bad actors on the network and returning false positive cases to active status in a timely manner. These goals will be accomplished by two innovative steps.   First, a Staking Bond will be required to request any removal submission on Crowdspot.  Secondly, a "Two & Banned" process is established on Crowdspot to end the revolving door of appeals to the denylist.  

## Motivation:

The current process and flow of the Crowdspot submissions is 4 months backlogged and in desperate need of attention.  The requests to Crowdspot will continue to grow if the process isn't improved. This has resulted in thousands of potentially false positive cases that can not get a fair review for months at a time.  

January 12th's algorithmic detection shutdown almost 20,000 gaming hotspots in one sweep! It was initially hailed as a success with a greater than 99% accuracy rate. Within days, it was announced that hundreds of hotspots were denied incorrectly by the algorithm.  Within a month it was announced that 1589 of those 20K had been removed from the denylist. Another month later on March 10th, it was announced that 2616 hotspots had been reviewed.  784 of 2616 submissions reviewed had been declined vs. 1832 of 2616 had been removed from the denylist, an accuracy rate of 30% among the 2616 reviews conducted.  Since March 10th, there have been no further official updates regarding the more than 4100 hotspots requesting reviews.  Furthermore on March 10th it was announced that April's Solana migration would temporarily slow down the rate of reviews.  Instead, the migration has nearly halted all review progress for the past 60 days. 
1182 removal requests have gone unanswered for more than 4 months. In one week that number will increase to 1552 submissions over 4 months old.  (Statistics pulled from @crey and @rokoshewsky)

## Stakeholders:

All Hotspot owners will be positively affected by this proposal, due to the processing of false positive cases in a timely manner, and returning legit hotspots back to active on the network. 
All Hotspot owners that were put on the denylist since January 2023 are negativity affected by the current state of Crowdspot processing review requests. 
Any community member that manually detects a spoofed hotspot or farm on the network has little to gain by reporting the fraudulent activity if the request isn't reviewed for months.  

## Detailed Explanation: 

### Definitions and variables to be established in this HIP

Staked bond- An amount of HNT to be locked up via Crowdspot and the Helium Wallet to accompany any removal submission as a good faith pledge by the hotspot owner.  The bond is intended to stifle known gamers from clogging the review system with frivolous removal submissions of obvious gaming hotspots.

Initial removal submission- After being denied by algorithmic detection, a request may be submitted by a hotspot owner via Crowdspot to have a member of the review team research the POC data of the hotspot to determine if the hotspot should be removed from the denylist.
 
Appeal removal submission- After the denial of an "initial removal submission" or after being placed on the denylist via an "addition request", a second and final request may be submitted by a hotspot owner via Crowdspot to have a second member of the review team determine if the hotspot should be removed from the denylist. 

Addition submission-  a request submitted by any member of the community via Crowdspot to have a member of the review team determine if POC gaming is present, and place the hotspot onto the denylist. 

Due notice of change- A message sent to the owner of any hotspot, via the Notifications section within the Helium Wallet, with regards to change of status on the denylist and of change of status on removal submissions initiated by the owner.   No reason, data, explanation, or guarantee shall be required in the notice.  Hotspot(s) name, and status is only required to be communicated.

Owner Cancellation- canceling of a removal submission by the owners' discretion in order to add evidence to a submission 

It is expected in the discussion process to determine exact values for two variables used throughout this HIP.   At this time they are open for discussion. Discussion should be held under the subsection titled "Unresolved Questions".  These variables are intended to become constant values before merging.  
var_submission_expiration_time = 60 days
var_staked_bond_amount = 5 HNT

### Changes to the Crowdspot UI or front-end
   
The Crowdspot website will be modified to give the user the options for the following.   
When creating any removal submission the types "Initial" or "Appeal" will be selected by the form based on prior submissions and based on how the hotspot(s) came to be on the denylist.  An "i" information box will be present next to each selection with the definition from this HIP of each type of removal submission.   
When creating any removal submission a section for Staked Bond will be presented.  An "i" informational box will be present within this section with the definition from this HIP for Staked Bond.   The user will have a check box present to indicate (insert legal disclaimer here)  "I understand that the HNT staked for the purpose of this submission may be forfeited if it is determined by the review team that I have represented my hotspot falsely to the network". 
For any pending submission, the Owner's shall be given access to cancel their own submissions prior to a determination by the review team.  Some owner cancelations come with penalties as discussed in Owner Deadlines.
Any "voting" references within Crowdspot shall be removed as it has no bearing on approvals or denials, and only serves to cloud the community's perception of how Crowdspot actually works.  

### Changes to Crowdspot backend

Only the hotspot owner can create a removal submission on a hotspot that they own.
The owner must include a staked bond with any type of removal submission.  
No other wallet shall be used for locking the staking bond other than the wallet currently linked to Crowdspot. 
The total Staked Bond will be a product of the number hotspots included on the submission multiplied by var_staked_bond_amount HNT. 
A mechanism shall be put in place to route any appeal submission to a different member of the review team than reviewed it's initial submission. 
Due Notice of change shall be sent to the hotspot owner regarding changes to their denylist status and/or changes to their submission status. 
At the time a hotspot address is being entered on a removal submission form, the data must be validated against the denylist and Crowdspot to determine the appropriate type of removal request to be labeled on the submission.  Initial removal submissions are permitted for hotspots that were denied via algorithmic detection and have not had a prior addition submission "accepted" by the review team.   Appeal removal submissions are permitted for hotspots that have a prior addition submission "accepted" by the review team  or have one prior initial removal submission as "declined" by the review team.   
In the event that an owner attempts to add multiple hotspots to a submission that are of mixed "initial" and "appeal" types, the form data shall not be validated and an error message shall alert the owner to try fewer hotspots per submission.  
"Two & Banned" - Only one initial removal submission and one appeal removal submission on a particular hotspot can ever be worked by the review team.  Once a determination of "declined" has been decided for an appeal submission, no removal submission can be accepted for that particular hotspot again. 

 ### Staked Bond in detail
 
The staked bond amount shall be var_staked_bond_amount HNT per hotspot. (This was intended to be approximately equivalent to the average network earnings of one hotspot for var_submission_expiration_time days.)  
Only one staked bond shall be locked up for the initial and appeal removal submission.  The staked bond shall be carried over from an initial removal submission into an appeal removal submission provided that the owner creates the appeal removal submission within var_submission_expiration_time days of the denial determination by the review team.   
Once a staked bond has been attached to a submission there is no guarantee that it will be returned to the owner.  This is intended to be a good faith deposit and attest to the Helium Network as a whole that you are not gaming the Network.  This is also intended to keep know gamers, that know they were gaming POC, from placing a removal submission in the event they have been caught.
The staked bond shall be immediately returned to the owner's wallet under any one of these three conditions:  
1. Any removal submission is approved by the review team and POC gaming was not substantiated. 
2. An Owner Cancelation is executed on an initial removal submission prior to a determination by the review team.  On appeal removal submissions, the staked bond can not be recovered by owner cancellation. See OWNER DEADLINES for details.  
3. The var_submission_expiration_time day time limit for any submission to be reviewed has expired. See REVIEW TEAM DEADLINES for details.  

The staked bond shall be forfeited under either of these two conditions:
1. On the var_submission_expiration_time +1 day (ie. 31st , 61st, 91st) after the initial removal submission was denied because the review team has positively determined that POC gaming was present and the owner has not opened an appeal removal submission.
2. In the event that an appeal removal submission is denied. The review team has positively determined that POC gaming is still present despite thoroughly pondering the most currently available evidence. 

### Owner deadlines and Responsibilities 

The Owner of the hotspot is responsible for the following prior to creating any removal submission.
Be sure that you are aware of the deadlines listed in this HIP. 
Be sure that your hotspot location is correctly asserted on the explorer map.  
Be sure that you are asserting the correct height and gain of the antenna you are using. 
Be sure that you have proper coax and connections. No attenuators, amplifiers, and no use of shared or multiple antennas.
Be sure there are no gaming devices, cluster packet fowarders, data credit farming or other unauthorized methods used to gain an unfair advantage to POC activity.
Be sure that you are giving all the true and factual information, photographic evidence and attaching pictures of your setup to the submission.  It is highly recommended that a file share site is used for all evidence so that addition evidence can be added without having to cancel and re-submit.  Canceling and re-submiting can also cause you to miss a deadline and forfeit the staked bond.   

#### Deadline for Initial Removal Submission
Removal submissions must be placed by the owner within var_submission_expiration_time days of a hotspot initially being placed on the denylist.  This is intended to increase the punishment for gamers by shutting the door on late submissions.  This is also intended to aid the workload management after a large ingestion of hotspots to the denylist and reduce overall workload for the volunteer members of the review team.  
   
#### Owner Cancelation of an initial removal submission. 
The owner shall immediately and automatically recover a staked bond by executing an Owner Cancelation of the initial removal submission prior to a determination by the review team.  The hotspot(s) will remain on the denylist, and the staked bond is returned.  The owner may make another initial removal submission, to include additional evidence, additional hotspots and the required stake bond within var_submission_expiration_time days of the algorithmic detection, not from the date of executing an owner cancellation.  

#### Deadline for Appeal Removal Submission 
There will be a var_submission_expiration_time day deadline to make an appeal removal submission after an addition submission has been accepted by a member of the review team and the hotspot has been denied, however, the already identified gamer only gets access to the appeal removal submission when creating the submission.  An initial removal submission will not be available via the Crowdspot interface if the hotspot was placed on the denylist by a team member via an addition submission. That is to say, if the team member already reviewed the data and determined that POC gaming was present, then the owner does not get an initial review, only an appeal. 

#### Owner cancellation of an appeal removal submission.
The owner shall not be able to recover a stake bond by canceling an appeal removal submission under any circumstances. The owner may cancel an appeal removal submission, however the hotspot(s) will remain on the denylist and the staked bond will not be returned.   The staked bond may be attached to a new appeal removal submission only for the same hotspots(s) and only within var_submission_expiration_time days of the initial removal submission being denied, or within var_submission_expiration_time days of the addition submission being accepted, not the date of cancelation.  

### Review team deadlines
Considerable increase in the severity of punishment has been established upon the alleged gamer within the provisions of this article.  The burden of proof, with staked bond increasing the ante, shortened deadlines, and "Two & Banned" have put down a clear line for gamers to think twice about opening a Crowdspot submission after being caught.  With these steep burdens to bear, one concession must be given to those falsely accused hotspot owners to get their hotspot reviewed in a timely manner. 
Initial removal submission shall be reviewed by the team within var_submission_expiration_time days or the hotspot is removed from the denylist, the stake bond shall be returned to the hotspot owner, and the submission shall be closed with the status of "deadline not met".  This is not to say that the algorithmic detection can not deny the hotspot again upon its first fraudulent POC activity.  

An appeal removal submission has already had one team memeber review by a human and possibly got there in the first place by algorithmic detection.  This case deserves a second look by the review team, however in the case that an appeal removal submission has not been reviewed in var_submission_expiration_time days the following shall occur.   The hotspot shall remain on the denylist, the stake bond shall be returned to the owner, and the submission shall be changed to the type addition submission and placed in that que for the review team at a later date.  

## Drawbacks
This could be seen as too harsh?  I jest.  The gamers on Helium Network should have a short life.  The owner who wants to correct his past transgressions should be offered the opportunity, but only through the strictest of gauntlets.   


## Rationale and Alternatives


I'm a big proponent of the "innocent until proven guilty" ethos. Right alongside this goes "the right to a fair and speedy trial."  The current state of Crowdspot serves neither. 


What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not choosing them?
HIP 66 and PR 551 both sought to work on Crowdspot and the impact of the denylist.   I think that both became stale.  


What is the impact of not doing this?

Each week more submissions are added to Crowdspot than are being removed.  The time for a review will grow so long that owners of legitimate hotspots that get falsely accused will have virtually no recourse.  Being put on the denylist will be equivalent to a perma-ban. 

Each day submissions are added to Crowdspot by already identified gamers asking for a review of the previous review of a farm that was denied 9 months ago, and further bogging down the system.  This revolving door must be stopped and penalties should be enacted for simply bogging down the system.  
 

## Unresolved Questions

How long is unreasonable to wait for a review? 
How much HNT to stake to hold your place on the list?
What to do with the 4100 backlogged requests?
What to do with forfeited HNT?

It is expected in the discussion process to determine the following variables in this HIP.  These current variables are only intended for the discussion process and are intended to become static once the discussion is finalized. 

var_submission_expiration_time = 60 days
var_staked_bond_amount = 5 HNT

The staked bond amount is intended to be approximately equivalent to the network average earnings of one hotspot for var_submission_expiration_time days.

For example 
0.07 HNT for 1 day
2.5 HNT for 30 days
5 HNT for 60 days


What about the 4100 submissions (4600 hotspots) that are currently backlogged on Crowdspot?   
Keep in mind that the current Crowdspot data from the Jan 12th sweep to date has shown about 1400 false positive hotspots were put on the deny list, 900 were determined to be gaming after human review, and 3600 are still pending reviews.  Then another approximately 800 hotspots are pending review that were not in the Jan 12 sweep.  

I have a couple of scenarios to clear out the log jam,  but I haven't worked out exactly what to do.  I'm really looking to the community (and perhaps members of the current review team) for the best answer.  

Scenario 1  Delete the entire crowdspot backlog and make everyone re-file under the new rules.  Give the the owner of any hotspot currently pending on crowdspot due notice that upon the successful voting and implementation of this HIP, everyone has to re-file under the new stiffer penalties of this HIP. 

Scenario 2  Delete the 4100 backlogged submissions and remove them from the denylist.  This would be the worst case scenario IMHO.  We release all the hotspots currently on removal requests back into the POC pool for 10 days, then let the algorithmic detection do its job with a new sweep.  When the new wave of submissions come in to Crowdspot, the new rules apply.  Perhaps a percentage of these hotpots have given up on Helium and unplugged and will never be heard from again anyway.  Perhaps the algorithmic detection has been tweaked enough since the January sweep to be less heavy handed.  Perhaps we will just encourage cheaters to keep cheating.  


Scenario 3  We control release of the submissions in scenario 2.  Only release 500 hotspots at a time and allow them to start POC activity again. Also, only release hotspots that were algorithmic detected on Jan 12th, definitely not hotspots that were manually determined.  Allow algorithmic detection to sweep them with a focus on those 500 hotspots, as they were previously suspected/detected of gaming.  This will slowly ease the backlog on crowdspot. All new removal requests that filter into Crowdspot are subject to the new rules of this HIP.  

Scenario 4  Keep the backlog of 4600 denied hotspots and submissions pending in crowdspot and start making any new submissions subject to the new rules.  I think that legit false positive owners will abandon the 4 month old submission and gladly "put their money where their mouth is".  

What about forfeited HNT?   I used the term "burn" earlier in this document. An alternative to this was proposed in PR 551.  Under PR 551, false positive hotspots were back paid rewards for the time spent falsely on the denylist.  One fault with PR 551 is where do those funds come from?  PR 551 was facing an issue of needing to carve out funds from epoch emissions, to redirect them toward false gamers.  We know that would be a dead argument and had stalled PR 551.
What about using HNT forfeited from gamers to reward false positive hotspots for their downtime?  I have an idea submitted by a community member that I will add here in the comments. 

## Deployment Impact

This portion is reserved for future use. 

## Success Metrics

The success metric will be the wait time for getting a human review after being placed on the denylist.   
Like pointed out in the Summary, the threshold for review should be less than 60 days, maybe even 30 days. The expected "customer service experience" should dictate that 4-6 months wait is simply unreasonable.
